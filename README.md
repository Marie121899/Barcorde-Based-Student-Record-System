# Barcorde-Based-Student-Record-System
Dashboard using R language

A barcode-based student record system is a technology-driven solution that aims to simplify the process of maintaining and managing student records. This system involves the use of barcodes, which are printed on ID cards, to capture and store student information in a centralised database. The system utilises barcode scanners to read the information on the ID cards and update the student records in real-time. The system provides a range of benefits, including the elimination of manual data entry and the reduction of errors associated with manual record keeping. It also enhances the security of student information by providing a secure and accurate method of identification. It can help avoid the queue at the gate when entering the school. Additionally, the system enables quick and easy access to student records, enabling educators and administrators to make informed decisions and improve the quality of education provided. The system was developed using R often used for its data analytics features. Students will just have to scan their cards using a barcode scanner and the system notes down when they arrived at school and their attendance as per dates. System then stores all the studentsâ€™ attendance records and generates a default list. It also generates an overall report in excel sheets for the school admin.
